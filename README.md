# Short Intro
I recreated the connections game from New York Times to play boards from future days. 

# Technologies Used
- TKinter for GUI
Install Tkinter:
brew update
brew reinstall python@3.13
brew reinstall tcl-tk
brew reinstall python-tk@3.13

# Features
- Pick between 91 days of connections games
- Functionality works

# The process
The earlier versions of the game stored future days in the html requests. Through inspect element I could view the json data and store it in a file. Then I parsed them to allow for the user to play any day. 

# What I learned


# How it can be improved
Functionally, the game works, but the current GUI doesn't give the best visual response. 

# Video showing how it works
